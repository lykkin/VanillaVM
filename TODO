ITT: a short list of goals for posterity
i may want to come back to work on some of these

(subsections are in no particular order)

FOR SURE:

abstract executor into its own class with the option for different threaded models

WRITE TESTS

break the parser out into its own file

allow "run once" instructions to set up an actor before it start executing

write a grid set up language parser

write a sudoku solver

add debug and diagnostics flags (at compile time? runtime flags?)


MAYBES:

allow for multiple dynamos, defined as a memory grid and set of actors

allow for pre-compiled binaries to avoid having to reparse an input file

allow actors to jump more than one space at a time (e.g. replace movement with an optional coordinate pair per line)

figure out how to allow users to extend the runtime, probably through bonders that can be named and fired using positional arguments (pretty much a janky function)


LONG TERM:

network/fs support

optimize/nodeps depending on how poor my judgement is
